# Mission_to_Mars
Web Scraping and Documentation Databases


In this project, we will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scraped the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collected the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. 


### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visited the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image 


### Mars Weather

* Visited the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scraped the latest Mars weather tweet from the page

### Mars Facts

* Visited the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visited the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.



## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

## Step 3 - Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.

2. Screenshots of your final application.

3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.

## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
